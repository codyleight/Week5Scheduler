# Week5Scheduler
Week 5 challenge, a day Scheduler.

## Description

Fifth Week - Creating a a dynamically changing scheduler, that will change depending on your local time. EX if it is 9 Am, 9 am will show red and the stuff in the future will be green. We also added a save function that will save the memo entered in the text area to that specific box when the corresponding save button for that box is pressed.

Used the Xpert Learning assistant to condense my code. Before implementing any suggestions I made sure to understand why and what I was doing. Mainly this was to condense If Statements.
Worked with Bijan Olfati and Jason Mason.
